Calctastrophe is our 3lb double vertical spinner built for NHRL and other combat robotics events. It runs two belt-driven vertical spinners that reach nearly 20,000 RPM, supported by a high-angled defensive wedge and forks that help us stay in control during engagements. For drive, we use a four-wheel belted system powered by brushed Dartbox Pro (Viper) motors, giving us solid pushing power and reliability around the arena.


## 🛠 Design Approach

This is our first build in the beetleweight class after spending time designing and building with fairyweight robots. A major focus for this robot was designing something we could realistically manufacture within the capabilities of the machines used in our school’s Computer Integrated Manufacturing class. With the exception of the AR500 weapon, 5052 aluminum wedge, and carbon fiber parts all of the major components were designed to be made using the tools we have access to, including the waterjet, CNC mill, and 3D printers. 


## Materials

We tried to balance competitive performance, durability, and cost while staying within our school’s manufacturing capabilities:

- **AR500** – Weapon  
- **6061 Aluminum** – Forks (Waterjet)
- **5052 Aluminum** – Wedge  
- **CF Nylon** – Frame and other complex 3D printed parts  
- **TPU** – Wheel guards and wheel hubs for impact absorption  
- **UHMW** – Uprights (CNC)
- **Carbon Fiber** - Top and Bottom Plates 

This combination let us experiment with more ambitious designs while gaining experience working with diverse machines and materials. We also aimed to use materials that we already had including the Just 'Cuz Robotics WEKA v2 ESC, Dartbox Pro, All-in-One PDB and Flysky FS-i6 +FS-ia6. 


## Drive & Weapons

The robot’s twin belt-driven vertical spinners provide the main offensive power, while the high defensive wedge helps us survive big hits and stay in control of engagements. The four-wheel belt drive offers consistent traction and good handling, and the brushed Dartbox Pro motors provide a solid balance of torque and reliability for the weight class.

## Current Update

I'm still working on building the physical robot, facing some belt geometry challenges. Though there are challenges, the drive system and electronics are functional and have been tested.
