# Morphing Quadcopter (In Progress)  
**Current Project**

## Goal
Develop and study the impact of extendable arms and variable rotor tilt on a quadcopter’s trajectory under various gust conditions.

---

## Overview

## Planned Features
- Servo-controlled telescopic arms  
- Variable rotor tilt via servos  
- PID controller for rotor tilt servos  

## Current Progress
- BOM has been constructed  
- Telescoping arms have been planned and partially modeled

## Challenges

When we started in the summer of 2025, my partner and I faced several design challenges. We initially set a strict constraint of achieving both the extension mechanism and rotor tilt mechanism using only two servos.  

Because of this constraint, we spent many work sessions struggling to develop solutions we were satisfied with. When I revisited the project, I removed that constraint, which significantly simplified the design and improved feasibility.

<br>Dual Servo Integration (for arm extension)<br><br>

- Round belts and timing belts will transmit motion to all four arms for extension.

## Current Update

I am currently in the design phase, modeling the moving stage (timing belt carriage) of the telescoping arms in Onshape.
