# Morphing Quadcopter ) 
**Current Project**

## Goal
Develop and study the impact of extendable arms and variable rotor tilt on a Quadcopter's trajectory with various gust patterns.

---

## Overview


Current Planned Features: 
- Servo controlled Telescopic Arms 
- Variable Rotor Tilt via Servos 
- PID controller on rotor tilt servos

Current Progress:
- BOM has been constructed
- Telescoping Arms have been planned out and partially modeled

### Challenges
While started in the Summer of 2025, my partner and I faced challenges during the development. We had set an incredibly hard constraint of achieving both the extension mechanism and rotor tilt mechanism with two servos.
Due to this, we spent many work sessions failing to come up with solutions we were happy with. When I picked up the project, I chose to remove that constraint, and I found that it simplified the design a lot.

<br>Dual Servo Integration (for arm extension)
<br> <t>- Round and timing belts will be used to transmit the motion to the four arms of the quadrotor for extension

## Current Update 
Right now, I'm still in the designing phase, working to model the moving stage (timing belt carriage) of the telescoping arms in Onshape.
