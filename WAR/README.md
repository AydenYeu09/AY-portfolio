# Autonomous Card Game Robot  
**Tufts University Engineering Design Lab – Pre-College Program**  
**July 2024**

## Goal
Prototype a mechatronics engineering system capable of autonomously playing a modified version of the card game *War* and cleaning up the table after each game.

---

## Overview

During the Tufts University Engineering Design Lab Pre-College Program, I worked in a team to design and build a fully autonomous robot that:

- Detects and identifies playing cards using computer vision  
- Plays the card game *War* autonomously  
- Determines round winners  
- Collects and organizes cards after each game  

---

## My Contributions

### Mechanical Design & CAD
- Designed robot components using CAD  
- Optimized parts for 3D printing and laser cutting  
- Iterated on robot end-effector mechanism for reliable card manipulation

### Electronics
- Designed and implemented the electronics layout  
- Integrated motors, a Raspberry Pi 3, and power systems  
- Organized wiring for reliability and serviceability  

### Software & Autonomy
- Developed Python code for autonomous operation  
- Used OpenCV for computer vision  
- Implemented:
  - Card detection
  - Card value recognition
  - Game logic for *War*
  - Automated cleanup routine  

---

## Technical Highlights

- Real-time card recognition using computer vision  
- Autonomous decision-making through implemented game logic  
- Rapid prototyping with 3D printing and laser cutting

## Engineering Challenges

- Reliable card detection under varying lighting conditions  
- Designing a mechanism capable of consistently handling thin playing cards  
- Debugging faulty electrical connections on the breadboard

---

## What I Learned

- Using AprilTag detection to retrieve values in addition to position
- Soldering and Breadboarding
- Importing custom parts in CAD 

---

## Final Outcome

The final system successfully:
- Played full rounds of *War* autonomously  
- Correctly determined winners  
- Reset the play area between games  

This project was my introduction to higher-level robotics projects requiring a greater knowledge of CAD, electronics, and code.
